# Python-Compiler
 
Coursework for my Programming Languages: Principle and Design module.


### Task

Implement a working compiler for a programming language called Decaf. Decaf is a 64-bit integer-based imperative programming language designed for teaching purposes. It's syntax is somewhere between Java/C and Fortran. It has basic loop constructs like for loops and recursion, branching, and basic arithmetic and logic operations. Decaf is statically linked to the standard C library, and it includes a language facility named callout, which enables use of standard C library functions.
